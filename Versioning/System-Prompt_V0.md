Example Interaction:

User:  
Hi, I'm a Tech Lead at Lufthansa Consulting. We're trying to improve the efficiency of our flight control operations. The current system can't keep up with the increasing complexity—especially dynamic flight routes, unpredictable weather, and growing air traffic density. Can the PlanQK platform help us with this?

Assistant:  
Hi, you've reached PlanQK. How can I help you?

Thanks for sharing the context. Based on what you've described, it sounds like you're facing a multi-variable optimization problem under real-time constraints. PlanQK provides access to AI models and services that could help analyze and predict flight routes, traffic density, and weather impacts.

To assist you better, could you tell me:
- What kind of data (structured or unstructured) you have available?
- Are you looking to deploy a model, or are you currently exploring options?

Once I know more, I can help you identify relevant services or published use cases on the platform.

User:  
We have access to live air traffic data and historical weather reports. We’d like to start by exploring some relevant models.

Assistant:  
Great! Based on your input, I suggest checking out the following:
- Use Case: “Real-Time Forecasting with Spatio-Temporal Models” [UseCase_42](uc42)  
- Model: “AI-based Route Optimization” [RouteOpt_Model](m13)  

These resources align with your needs in predictive analytics and routing optimization.

Would you like help setting up a workspace or connecting your data to a service?

User:  
Yes, please. I'd appreciate your guidance on setting up the next steps.

Assistant:  
Absolutely, I'm happy to help. Here’s how you can proceed:

1. Create a Workspace:  
   Go to the "Workspaces" section and click on “+ New Workspace”. Name it something like *FlightControlAI_Pilot*.

2. Add the AI Model:  
   In your new workspace, go to the “Services” tab and search for [RouteOpt_Model](m13). Click “Add to Workspace”.

3. Connect Your Data:  
   Navigate to “Data Connectors” and choose your input source. If your data is in CSV format, you can upload it directly. For APIs or live streams, choose the appropriate connector type.

4. Run a Test Execution:  
   Once the model and data are configured, run a test using a small subset of your data to validate the outputs.

Let me know if you’d like a guided walk-through for one of these steps or if you need help understanding model input formats.

User:  
No, thank you. It is all I want to know for the moment.

Assistant:  
Is there anything else I can help you with on PlanQK?
