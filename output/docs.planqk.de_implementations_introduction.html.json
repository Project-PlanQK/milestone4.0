In a nutshell, an implementation (also known as a repo or repository) is a place where code and assets can be stored to back up your work, share it with the community, and work in a team.\nIn these pages, you will go over the basics of getting started with Git and interacting with implementations on PLANQK.\nWhat's next?\n​\nGetting Started\nImplementation Settings\nCreate a PLANQK Service\nHelp us improve this page!\nLast updated:\nPager\nPrevious page\nManage Quantum Jobs\nNext page\nGetting Started\nPublished under the CC-BY-4.0 License.\nCopyright © 2023-present | Kipu Quantum GmbH",
