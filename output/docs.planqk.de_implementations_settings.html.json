Unless the implementation is owned by an\norganization\n, you are the only one who can see your implementation and update any code. In the settings of your implementation you can change the visibility to\npublic\n.\nPublic\nmeans that all PLANQK users can see your implementation and its code. However, they are not allowed to make any changes to your implementation.\nManaging Members\n​\nIf you want to grant certain users access to your implementation, you can add them as members. A member can have the role\nViewer\n,\nMaintainer\nor\nOwner\n.\nViewer\n: Can see the implementation and its code, but cannot make any changes.\nMaintainer\n: Has all the rights of a Viewer and can make changes to the code.\nOwner\n: Has all rights of a Maintainer and can manage the implementation settings, e.g., adding users, changing the visibility, and deleting the implementation.\nHelp us improve this page!\nLast updated:\nPager\nPrevious page\nGetting Started\nNext page\nCreate a Service\nPublished under the CC-BY-4.0 License.\nCopyright © 2023-present | Kipu Quantum GmbH",
