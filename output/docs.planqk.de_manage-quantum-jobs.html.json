This feature helps you save costs, especially if expensive jobs are accidentally submitted to costly backends.\nManaging Service Jobs\n​\nAs a service host, you can view the input data and results of jobs initiated by your service’s executions. Additionally, you have the ability to cancel any jobs that are queued from a service execution.\nFollow these steps to view jobs associated with a specific service execution:\nClick on \"Applications\" tab in the main menu. If you want to access the jobs of your organization, ensure that you selected it, in the top left corner.\nChoose your subscribed service from the list of subscribed services.\nIn the \"Subscriptions\" section, click on \"Activity Logs\".\nLocate the relevant service execution and click on \"Show Jobs\".\nNOTE\nDue to confidentiality reasons, you\ncannot\naccess jobs from service executions initiated by external users or organizations, even if you are hosting the service.\nHelp us improve this page!\nLast updated:\nPager\nPrevious page\nManage Access Tokens\nNext page\nIntroduction\nPublished under the CC-BY-4.0 License.\nCopyright © 2023-present | Kipu Quantum GmbH\n\nsource: https://docs.planqk.de/manage-quantum-jobs.html",
