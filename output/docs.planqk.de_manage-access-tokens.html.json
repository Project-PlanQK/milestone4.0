This is especially useful when you want to execute your quantum solutions using your own accounts for certain quantum backends (bring your own token).\nPersonal Access Tokens\n​\nYou can use personal access tokens to access the PLANQK API, e.g., by the\nPLANQK CLI\nor by the\nPLANQK Quantum SDK\n. Further, you can use them to authenticate any custom application that wants to interact with the PLANQK Platform API.\nTo create a personal access token to your account, go to the user-menu in the top right corner and click on \"Settings\". Under \"Personal Access Tokens\" you can create new personal access tokens and manage existing ones.\nNOTE\nPersonal access tokens can only be created for user accounts. You can use your personal access token to interact with organizations you are a member of.\nProvider Access Tokens\n​\nBy bringing your own access tokens, you can use your own accounts for certain quantum backends. This allows PLANQK to access quantum backend providers at runtime.\nTo add a token for your account, go to the user-menu in the top right corner and click on \"Settings\". Under \"Provider Access Tokens\" you can add different tokens to your account, depending on the provider.\nAlternatively, when you are an owner or maintainer of an organization, you can provide access tokens in the section \"Provider Access Tokens\" of your organization settings. If provided, every member of the organization can run circuits/jobs with these access tokens.\nHelp us improve this page!\nLast updated:\nPager\nPrevious page\nManage Organizations\nNext page\nManage Quantum Jobs\nPublished under the CC-BY-4.0 License.\nCopyright © 2023-present | Kipu Quantum GmbH\n\nsource: https://docs.planqk.de/manage-access-tokens.html",
